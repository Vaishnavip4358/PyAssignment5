Module 6: Data Structures in Python

This repository contains my submission for Assignment 5. The project demonstrates the use of Python data structures such as dictionaries and lists, along with user input handling and list slicing techniques.

Tasks Overview
Task 1: Student Marks Dictionary Lookup

File: task1_dictionary.py

Creates a dictionary where student names are stored as keys and their marks as values.

Prompts the user to enter a student’s name.

Retrieves and displays the corresponding marks if the student exists.

Displays an appropriate message if the student record is not found.

Concepts Used:

Python Dictionaries

User Input (input())

Conditional Statements (if-else)

f-Strings for formatted output

Task 2: List Slicing and Reversing

File: task2_list.py

Creates a list of numbers from 1 to 10.

Extracts the first five elements using list slicing.

Reverses the extracted elements using slicing technique.

Prints the original list, extracted list, and reversed list.

Concepts Used:

Python Lists

range() function

List Slicing

List Reversal using [::-1]
